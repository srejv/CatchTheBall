I am too lazy to add any licence. 

So. Do whatever, man. 
House game. Mod as you please. 


Current Game Rules:

	Catch the star.
	You cannot ride through other players. 
	Rotate on standby, move on activate!
	Your activation button is the one in the parentheses (how do you even spell this?)
	No other rules. Ends when you feel like it. 
	
	(fun mod, make it slow like 0.25-0.5 for every hit instead of halting)
